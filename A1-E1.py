word1= "Coding" #input the variables written from the exercise
word2= "is"
word3= "Cool"


print(word1,""+word2,"" +word3) #since it mentioned to make string 
#concatenation, (string=letters) so with that I typed in (word1,word2,word3)
#to make it easier if I ever wrote something long.
#I then added (" ")to put spaces between the words,
#then added + to make it in one line.
